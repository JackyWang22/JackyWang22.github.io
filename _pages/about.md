# About Me        
* I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University. I obtained my PhD in Data Science at [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/).

* My research interests lie in general area of machine learning, particularly in large language model, multi-modal foundation models, learning with imperfect datasets (corrupted data, limited supervision, small data, etc.) as well as their applications in medicine and biology. When I was at NYU, I was a member of the Math and Data (MAD) group where I worked on inverse problems and optimization. I love playing tennis, scuba diving, surfing and any water sports. 

* Check out more information from my [CV](https://shengliu66.github.io/files/ShengLiu-CV.pdf) and [research statement](https://shengliu66.github.io/files/ShengLiu-Research_Statement.pdf) 

* I defended my PhD and graduated from NYU this summer!
