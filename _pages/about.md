I am a thrid year PhD student in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/), supervised by [Dr. Ipek Oguz](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/ipek-oguz), [Dr. Yuankai (Kenny) Tao](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/tao-yuankaikenny), and [Dr. Francesca Bagnato](https://www.vumc.org/neurology/person/francesca-bagnato-md-phd). I am a member of [MedICL](https://github.com/MedICL-VU), [Bagnato Lab](https://www.vumc.org/bagnato-lab/person/our-team) and [VISE](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/). I previsouly worked with [Dr. Yu-Shin Ding](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/yu-shin-ding) at New York University Grossman School of Medicine and [Dr. H. Jonathan Chao](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/h-jonathan-chao) at NYU CATT. Also, I spent a great time working at Columbia University Medical Center/[NYSPI](https://nyspi.org/) with Dr. Yunsuo Duan and [Dr. Tommy Vaughan](https://mr.research.columbia.edu/content/john-t-vaughan-jr).

I am deeply engaged in exploring the realms of self and semi-supervised learning within machine and deep learning, specifically tailored to the field of medical imaging. My focus is on advancing generative models capable of effectively learning from imperfect datasets characterized by limited and noisy data. I bring extensive experience in various imaging modalities, including neuroimaging with a focus on multiple sclerosis, PET imaging, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images.
